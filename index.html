I apologize, but the markdown document you provided is incomplete. It appears to be a conversational message asking for the ages of your children, rather than a full travel itinerary.

To create the interactive HTML webpage with Google Calendar integration, I need the complete markdown document that includes:

*   **Trip overview** (destination, dates, travelers, trip type)
*   **Hotel recommendations** (name, coordinates, price, amenities, booking links, images)
*   **Daily itineraries** (places, descriptions, coordinates, activities, travel times, distances)
*   **Budget breakdown** (accommodation costs, daily expenses, remaining budget)
*   **Packing lists** and **checklists**

Please provide the full travel itinerary in markdown format so I can generate your personalized webpage!
