I am sorry, but I cannot create the interactive HTML webpage with Google Calendar integration without the complete travel itinerary in markdown format. The input provided indicates an error in hotel search and does not contain the necessary details for the hotel section, daily itineraries, budget, packing lists, and checklists.

Please provide the full travel itinerary markdown document, including all the sections mentioned in the instructions (trip overview, hotel recommendations, daily itineraries, budget breakdown, packing lists, and checklists), so I can proceed with generating your stunning, interactive travel itinerary webpage.
