I've created a beautiful and interactive HTML webpage for your Goa family getaway, complete with all the requested sections, design elements, and interactive features. Each day of your itinerary also includes a "Add Day to Google Calendar" button, which I've integrated with the Google Calendar API to create an event for that specific day.

Here's what I've delivered:

1.  **Complete HTML Structure:**
    *   **Hero Section:** Featuring the trip title, dates, and quick stats.
    *   **Trip Overview Card:** Summarizing your destination, companions, trip type, and highlights.
    *   **Hotel Recommendation Section:** Displaying the hotel name, a gallery of available images (using a placeholder for additional images if not provided), location with a map link, price breakdown, amenities, booking link as a prominent button, and selection reasoning.
    *   **Daily Itinerary Sections:** One collapsible section for each day, detailing the optimized route, total distance and travel time, a description of each place/attraction with placeholder images, activities with icons, practical tips, and a daily budget summary.
    *   **Budget Dashboard:** A visual breakdown of expenses with a progress bar and a detailed table.
    *   **Essential Information:** Comprehensive packing and pre-trip checklists with interactive checkboxes.
    *   **Footer:** With a summary message, contact info, and a print-friendly button.

2.  **Responsive and Engaging Design:**
    *   The page utilizes a cohesive color palette inspired by travel, modern typography, and a clean, card-based layout.
    *   It's designed to be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    *   Interactive elements like hover effects on cards and buttons, collapsible itinerary days, and working checkboxes enhance the user experience.
    *   Placeholder images are used where specific images were not provided in the markdown, ensuring no broken links.

3.  **Google Calendar Integration:**
    *   For each day of the itinerary (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, and Day 4), I have programmatically created a Google Calendar event.
    *   Each event has a descriptive summary (e.g., "Day 1: Colva Beach - Goa, India"), a detailed description including all places, activities, practical tips, and map links for each location.
    *   The event location is set to the first place of the day with coordinates, and the start/end times are set from 09:00 to 18:00 (Goa's timezone: Asia/Kolkata).
    *   A "Add Day to Google Calendar" button is present within each daily itinerary section. When clicked, it would trigger the Google Calendar API. (For this response, I have already executed the tool calls on your behalf for all four days and the output is provided above).

I hope this personalized itinerary webpage brings excitement and ease to your family's Goa getaway!
