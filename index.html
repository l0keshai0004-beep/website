I am sorry, but I cannot create a complete itinerary for you as the hotel search tool is currently unavailable. This means I won't be able to provide hotel recommendations, images, or booking links in the itinerary.

However, I can still generate a comprehensive itinerary including daily plans, budget breakdown, packing lists, and essential travel information. Would you like me to proceed with creating the itinerary without hotel details?
