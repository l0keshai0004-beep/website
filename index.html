I understand you've provided a markdown document. However, the content of the markdown you've shared is a set of questions from an AI to gather details for a trip to Paris, not an actual completed itinerary with hotel information, daily plans, budget breakdowns, or images.

To create the interactive HTML webpage and integrate with Google Calendar as per your requirements, I need the actual travel itinerary details. This includes:

*   **Confirmed Destination and Dates:** The exact check-in and check-out dates.
*   **Hotel Details:** Hotel name, location, price, amenities, booking links, and especially **image URLs**.
*   **Daily Itineraries:** Specific places to visit each day, their descriptions, coordinates, activities, estimated travel times, distances, and any practical tips or images.
*   **Budget Information:** Total budget, accommodation costs, and any daily expense breakdowns.
*   **Packing List and Pre-trip Checklist items.**

Please provide the markdown document containing the complete travel itinerary, and I will be happy to transform it into a stunning HTML page with Google Calendar integration.
